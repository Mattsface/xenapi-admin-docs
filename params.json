This repository will be used primarily for our own build systems to create the documentation without polluting the official xen-org source tree. \r\n\r\nTo get the docs project files\r\n```\r\n$  git clone https://github.com/Xenapi-Admin-Project/xenapi-admin-docs\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Xenapi Admin Guides\r\nWe've created specific guides for what will be included in our documentation and how it will be structured. A portion of this section will be used for manpage and other document templates as well as documentation outlining our publishing system (asciidoc/docbook).\r\n\r\n### Xenapi Admin Build System\r\nWe use a custom set of scripts for building our asciidoc source documentation into manpages and other formats. Files associated with this build system will be found here.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nXenapi Admin Docs is managed by the Xenapi Admin Project. Current team members are Grant McWilliams @grantmcwilliams, Lisa Nguyen @lisatn, Matthew Spah @mattsface, Michael Webber @mrwebberone and Paul Maack @PaulTMaack.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
